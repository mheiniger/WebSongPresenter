##Web Song Presenter

This is a little nodejs application which aims to display songs to a beamer, only using node for server and two Browsers.
Different scenarios are possible:

* 1 computer with a display and a beamer attached
* 2 computers, one for controlling, one for to display 
* additional (mobile) devices with a browser, to switch pages or see a preview (or both)
